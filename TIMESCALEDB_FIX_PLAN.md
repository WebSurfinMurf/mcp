# TimescaleDB MCP Fix Plan
*Created: 2025-09-07*
*Following Validate-First Philosophy*

## Current Problem

### Symptoms
```
WARNING:root:Failed to validate request: Received request before initialization was complete
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"error":{"code":-32602,"message":"Invalid request parameters","data":""}}
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The TimescaleDB MCP is a Python-based server running in Docker that requires proper MCP initialization sequence:
1. Client sends `initialize` request
2. Server responds with capabilities
3. Only then can `tools/list` be called

The issue appears to be that the Python MCP server isn't handling the initialization properly.

## Investigation Plan

### Step 1: Understand Current Implementation
- Check Python version and MCP library version
- Review server.py initialization code
- Check if it matches the documented fix from CLAUDE.md

### Step 2: Test Direct Docker Execution
- Run the Docker container interactively
- Send proper initialization sequence
- Verify if it's a wrapper issue or server issue

### Step 3: Compare with Working Services
- n8n uses bash wrapper - works ✓
- playwright uses Node.js - works ✓
- TimescaleDB uses Docker wrapper - fails ✗
- Is it the Docker wrapper or Python MCP?

## Fix Approaches (in order of preference)

### Approach 1: Fix Python Server Code
If the server.py doesn't handle initialization properly:
1. Update initialization code
2. Rebuild Docker image
3. Test with proper sequence

### Approach 2: Create Node.js Wrapper
If Python MCP is problematic:
1. Create a Node.js wrapper that calls Python
2. Use the working pattern from n8n
3. Avoid Docker for MCP layer

### Approach 3: Direct Python Execution
If Docker wrapper is the issue:
1. Install Python dependencies locally
2. Run Python directly without Docker
3. Use environment variables for config

## Validation Checkpoints

### Before Fix
- [ ] Current error documented
- [ ] Python MCP version identified
- [ ] Initialization code reviewed

### During Fix
- [ ] Test after each code change
- [ ] Verify initialization response
- [ ] Check tools/list works

### After Fix
- [ ] Standalone test passes
- [ ] Proxy integration works
- [ ] All other services still work

## Success Criteria
1. TimescaleDB responds to initialization
2. Tools list is accessible
3. At least one tool can be executed
4. Service works via SSE proxy
5. No impact to other services

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Code changes to Python server
- **Medium Risk**: Switching to different wrapper approach
- **Mitigation**: Keep backup of current state, test thoroughly
