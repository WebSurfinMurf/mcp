# MCP/MCP-Proxy Review Issues

- **Secrets exposed in repository artifacts (High)**. Evidence: the live bearer token appears in documentation at `mcp/proxy/status.md:6` and `mcp/proxy/status.md:57`, and in auto-created backups such as `mcp/proxy/config/config.json.bak-20250924-081523:10`. Impact: anyone with repo access can reuse the production token, defeating the proxyâ€™s authentication. Recommendation: purge committed copies, extend `.gitignore` to cover `config/*.bak`, and redact the token from status docs.
- **`render-config.sh` wipes registered services during token rotation (High)**. The script rebuilds `config/config.json` solely from `config/config.template.json` (`mcp/proxy/render-config.sh:36`), but the template only defines the `test` backend (`mcp/proxy/config/config.template.json:12`) while the live config has additional services (`mcp/proxy/config/config.json:15`). Impact: regenerating the config (e.g., when rotating the token) removes the filesystem and fetch registrations, breaking clients until they are re-added manually. Recommendation: have the renderer merge into the existing config or keep the template in sync with every active service before running it.
- **Filesystem bridge cannot fulfill write operations (High)**. The bridge mounts `/home/administrator/projects` read-only at `mcp/filesystem/bridge/docker-compose.yml:13`, yet the deployment notes promise `write_file` and other mutating tools via the proxy (`mcp/proxy/status.md:61`). Impact: any attempt to modify files through the MCP toolbox will fail with permission errors. Recommendation: switch the mount to read-write (or document the read-only limitation and remove write tools).
- **Documentation overstates available backends (Medium)**. `mcp/proxy/CLAUDE.md:9` advertises PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB SSE endpoints, but the active config and status only list `test`, `filesystem`, and `fetch` (`mcp/proxy/config/config.json:15`, `mcp/proxy/status.md:10`). Impact: operators following the docs will point clients at `/postgres/sse` or `/timescaledb/sse` and get 404/connection errors. Recommendation: either add those services to the central config or revise the documentation to reflect actual availability.
