# Factual Analysis of `mcp-fetch` Connection Failure

## Executive Summary

The `mcp-fetch-bridge` service is confirmed to be running, healthy, and accessible from within its Docker network. The `mcp-proxy` is also confirmed to be running and is correctly configured to route requests to the `mcp-fetch-bridge`. However, the Claude Code CLI is unable to establish a successful connection to the `mcp-fetch` service via the proxy, showing a "failed" status.

## Verified Facts

1.  **`mcp-fetch-bridge` is Healthy and Responsive:**
    *   The container is in a `healthy` state.
    *   A direct `curl` test from within the `mcp-net` Docker network to `http://mcp-fetch-bridge:9072/fetch/sse` returns an `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` and SSE data. This definitively proves the service is working correctly.

2.  **`mcp-proxy` is Correctly Configured for `fetch`:**
    *   The `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/proxy/config/config.json` file contains the correct entry for the `fetch` service:
      ```json
      "fetch": {
        "url": "http://mcp-fetch-bridge:9072/fetch/sse"
      }
      ```
    *   The proxy's logs show that it successfully initializes both the `postgres` and `fetch` services upon startup.

3.  **`mcp-proxy` is Not Receiving Requests for `/fetch/sse`:**
    *   Despite the CLI showing a "failed" status for the `fetch` server, there are **no corresponding log entries** in the `mcp-proxy` logs for requests to `/fetch/sse`.
    *   This is the same behavior we observed with the `postgres` service before we corrected the URL path in the CLI.

4.  **Claude CLI is Correctly Configured:**
    *   The `claude mcp add-json` command was used to add the `fetch` server with the following, correct configuration:
      ```json
      {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "http://localhost:9090/fetch/sse",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"
        }
      }
      ```

## Conclusion

Based on the facts, the logical conclusion is that the Claude Code CLI is **not sending requests to the correct URL** (`http://localhost:9090/fetch/sse`).

The evidence for this is the lack of log entries in the `mcp-proxy`. If the CLI were sending requests to the correct URL, we would see them in the proxy's logs, even if they were failing for some other reason.

This points to a potential caching issue within the CLI, where it is still using an old or incorrect URL for the `fetch` service, despite being re-configured.
