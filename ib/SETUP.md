# IB Gateway + MCP Setup Complete! ✅

## Current Status

Both services are running and configured:
- ✅ IB Gateway container running
- ✅ IB MCP server running
- ✅ VNC enabled and accessible via Guacamole
- ✅ Secrets moved to `/home/administrator/projects/secrets/mcp-ib.env`

## Access IB Gateway GUI

**Via Guacamole (Web Browser):**
1. Open: http://localhost:8090
2. Login: `guacadmin` / `guacadmin`
3. Click: **"IB Gateway"**
4. You'll see the IB Gateway interface in your browser!

## Next Step: Add Your IB Credentials

Edit the secrets file:
```bash
nano /home/administrator/projects/secrets/mcp-ib.env
```

Update these values:
```bash
IB_USERNAME=your_actual_ib_username
IB_PASSWORD=your_actual_ib_password
TRADING_MODE=paper  # or 'live' for real trading
```

Then restart:
```bash
cd /home/administrator/projects/mcp-ib
docker compose restart
```

Watch the login process in Guacamole - if you have 2FA, you'll need to respond to prompts.

## Ports

- **14002**: IB Gateway Paper Trading API
- **14001**: IB Gateway Live Trading API
- **15900**: VNC (direct access, not needed with Guacamole)
- **3000**: MCP Server

- `.gitignore` prevents committing secrets
- No credentials in project directories

✅ **VNC Password set:**
- Password: `Qwer-0987on` (stored in secrets file)
- Already configured in Guacamole connection
