# MCP Postgres Fix - Session Context

## Goal

Get the `mcp-postgres` tools to be available and functional within the Gemini CLI.

## Current Status

1.  **Problem Identified**: The `mcp-postgres` tools were not appearing in the Gemini CLI.

2.  **Investigation Summary**:
    *   The `mcp-postgresql` container is confirmed to be running, healthy, and listening on port 8080.
    *   The LiteLLM gateway is configured to connect to this container, but the tools are not being exposed through it.

3.  **Action Taken**:
    *   As a diagnostic measure, I have bypassed the LiteLLM gateway.
    *   I have directly added the `mcp-postgresql` tool to the Gemini configuration file (`/home/administrator/.gemini/settings.json`).
    *   The endpoint for this direct connection has been set to `http://linuxserver.lan:8080`.

4.  **Pending Action**:
    *   The user needs to restart the Gemini CLI to see if this direct configuration makes the postgres tools appear.

## Next Steps

*   **If the tools are visible after restart**: This will confirm the issue lies with the LiteLLM gateway's tool aggregation. The next step would be to investigate the LiteLLM configuration and logs.

*   **If the tools are still not visible after restart**: This would indicate a problem with the `mcp-postgresql` service itself or its communication with the Gemini CLI. The next step would be to inspect the logs of the `mcp-postgresql` container for errors.
