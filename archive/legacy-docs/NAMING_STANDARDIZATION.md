# MCP Naming Standardization Complete
*Date: 2025-09-07*
*Status: ✅ Successfully Implemented*

## Summary
Following the Validate-First Philosophy and understanding that only one instance of each MCP service runs at a time, we've successfully implemented standard naming for all MCP Docker containers.

## Key Understanding
- MCP services are called on-demand via stdio
- Only one instance of each service runs at a time
- Containers terminate after processing requests
- No need for unique/dynamic naming - standard names work perfectly

## Naming Convention: `mcp-{service}`

### Container Names Now In Use:
- `mcp-filesystem` - File operations
- `mcp-fetch` - Web content fetching  
- `mcp-postgres-stdio` - PostgreSQL operations (stdio suffix to distinguish from persistent mcp-postgres)
- `mcp-timescaledb` - Time-series database operations

### Non-Docker Services (No container naming needed):
- `monitoring` - Runs as Node.js process
- `n8n` - Runs as Node.js with bash wrapper
- `playwright` - Runs as Node.js process

## Implementation Details

### Created Wrapper Scripts
Each Docker-based service now has a wrapper script that:
1. Stops any existing container with the same name
2. Removes the stopped container
3. Runs new container with standard name

Example: `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/filesystem/mcp-wrapper.sh`
```bash
CONTAINER_NAME="mcp-filesystem"
docker stop ${CONTAINER_NAME} 2>/dev/null || true
docker rm ${CONTAINER_NAME} 2>/dev/null || true
exec docker run --rm -i --name "${CONTAINER_NAME}" ...
```

### Updated Proxy Configuration
Modified `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/proxy-sse/servers-production.json` to use wrapper scripts instead of direct Docker commands:
```json
"filesystem": {
  "command": "bash",
  "args": ["/home/administrator/projects/mcp/filesystem/mcp-wrapper.sh"],
  "description": "File system operations"
}
```

## Verification Results

### All Services Working ✅
- filesystem: Working via wrapper
- fetch: Working via wrapper
- postgres: Working via wrapper
- timescaledb: Working via wrapper
- monitoring: Working (Node.js)
- n8n: Working (Node.js)
- playwright: Working (Node.js)

### Container Naming Verified ✅
```
mcp-filesystem       mcp/filesystem
mcp-fetch           mcp/fetch
mcp-postgres-stdio  crystaldba/postgres-mcp
mcp-timescaledb     mcp-timescaledb:latest
mcp-proxy-sse       mcp-proxy-custom:latest
```

No more randomly named containers like "hardcore_ishizaka" or "fervent_euclid"!

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Predictable naming**: Easy to identify and manage containers
2. **No accumulation**: Old containers are cleaned up automatically
3. **Simpler debugging**: `docker ps | grep mcp-` shows all MCP containers
4. **Consistent standards**: All MCP services follow same pattern
5. **No conflicts**: Since only one runs at a time, static names work perfectly

## Files Modified
- `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/filesystem/mcp-wrapper.sh` (created)
- `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/fetch/mcp-wrapper.sh` (created)
- `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/postgres/mcp-wrapper.sh` (created)
- `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/timescaledb/mcp-wrapper-fixed.sh` (updated)
- `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/proxy-sse/servers-production.json` (updated)

## Secrets Standardization Also Complete
- All secrets now in `/home/administrator/secrets/mcp-{service}.env`
- Removed embedded secrets from code where possible
- Consistent naming pattern throughout
