# MCP Standardization Complete
*Date: 2025-09-07*
*Status: ✅ Successfully Standardized*

## Summary
Following the Validate-First Philosophy, we've successfully standardized the MCP infrastructure:
- ✅ All secrets moved to `$HOME/projects/secrets/` with consistent naming
- ✅ Removed hardcoded secrets where possible
- ✅ Updated configurations to use standardized paths
- ✅ All 7 services validated and working

## Changes Made

### 1. Secret Files Standardization
Created/updated standardized secret files:
- `$HOME/projects/secrets/mcp-postgres.env` (existing)
- `$HOME/projects/secrets/mcp-timescaledb.env` (new)
- `$HOME/projects/secrets/mcp-n8n.env` (migrated from n8n-mcp.env)
- `$HOME/projects/secrets/mcp-memory-postgres.env` (existing)

### 2. Configuration Updates
- **n8n wrapper**: Updated to use `$HOME/projects/secrets/mcp-n8n.env`
- **TimescaleDB wrapper**: Updated to load from `$HOME/projects/secrets/mcp-timescaledb.env`
- **Proxy configuration**: Removed hardcoded TimescaleDB credentials (now loaded from secret file)
- **PostgreSQL**: Kept hardcoded DATABASE_URI due to environment variable expansion limitations

### 3. Cleanup
- Removed `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/timescaledb/.env` (secrets moved to standard location)
- Cleaned up unnamed containers spawned by proxy

## Naming Conventions Established

### Directory Structure
```
/home/administrator/projects/mcp/
├── fetch/           # Service directories use simple names
├── filesystem/
├── memory-postgres/
├── monitoring/
├── n8n/
├── playwright/
├── postgres/
├── proxy/
└── timescaledb/
```

### Secret Files
Pattern: `$HOME/projects/secrets/mcp-{service}.env`
- mcp-postgres.env
- mcp-timescaledb.env
- mcp-n8n.env
- mcp-memory-postgres.env

### Docker Container Names
- Production containers: `mcp-{service}` (e.g., mcp-postgres, mcp-proxy-sse)
- Proxy-spawned containers: Auto-generated names (cleaned up periodically)

## Known Behavior

### Container Spawning
The MCP proxy spawns containers without `--name` flags to avoid conflicts. This results in Docker auto-generated names like:
- hardcore_ishizaka
- fervent_euclid
- great_northcutt

**Solution**: Run `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/cleanup-containers.sh` periodically to clean up stopped containers.

## Validation Results

All services tested and confirmed working via SSE proxy (port 8585):
- ✅ filesystem - Working
- ✅ monitoring - Working  
- ✅ fetch - Working
- ✅ postgres - Working
- ✅ n8n - Working
- ✅ playwright - Working
- ✅ timescaledb - Working

## Security Improvements
1. No secrets in git repositories
2. Centralized secret management in `$HOME/projects/secrets/`
3. Wrapper scripts load credentials at runtime
4. Removed unnecessary environment variable exposure in proxy config

## Recommendations
1. Set up cron job to run cleanup script daily
2. Consider implementing container name prefixes in proxy code
3. Document secret rotation procedures
4. Add secret validation to deployment scripts

## Files Modified
- `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/n8n/mcp-wrapper.sh`
- `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/timescaledb/mcp-wrapper-fixed.sh`  
- `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/proxy-sse/servers-production.json`
- Removed: `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/timescaledb/.env`

## Next Steps
1. Update any deployment documentation with new secret paths
2. Consider automating container cleanup with systemd timer
3. Add secret rotation procedures to security documentation
