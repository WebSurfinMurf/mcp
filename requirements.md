I want to deploy best of breed, pre-defined MCP connectors for the services I currently have. 

projects/mcp/fetch
projects/mcp/playwright
projects/mcp/timescaledb
projects/mcp/n8n
projects/mcp/minio
projects/mcp/postgres

For these MCP,s propritize mcp tools that have material community support and adoption, if there is more than one with similiar adoption, choose the one aligned with the core project if one exists.
I want all of them deployed locally in respective directories.

I want to register them to a central mcp server to make them all available via a single connection.
I want the single central mcp server capability to be available on my linuxserver.lan for claude code cli, gemini cli, optionally chatgpt codex cli, open-webui, and vs code on a different machine on the local network.
First assigment is to identify what community supported tools are available to help maintain and make mcp's available in this manner.
I'll add to this requirement once we identify the right solution.
