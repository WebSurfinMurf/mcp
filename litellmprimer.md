### **LiteLLM: The Universal LLM Gateway - A Technical Guide**

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of LiteLLM, its core functionalities, and how to leverage its powerful features for building robust, scalable AI applications.

-----

#### **1. What is LiteLLM?**

LiteLLM is an open-source library that acts as a universal adapter for over 100 Large Language Model (LLM) providers.[1, 2] Its primary purpose is to standardize interaction with a fragmented ecosystem of LLM APIs, allowing developers to write code once and seamlessly switch between different models (e.g., from OpenAI to Azure, Anthropic, Groq, or a local Ollama instance) with minimal to no code changes.[1, 3]

LiteLLM is available in two primary forms [4]:

  * **Python SDK:** A lightweight client library for developers to directly integrate multi-provider LLM access into their Python applications.
  * **Proxy Server (LLM Gateway):** A standalone, production-grade server that centralizes LLM access, management, and governance for teams and organizations.[4]

-----

#### **2. Core Capabilities**

LiteLLM provides a unified interface, standardizing on the popular OpenAI API format for inputs and outputs. This allows you to use familiar tools, like the official OpenAI client, to interact with any supported model.[4, 5]

**Key Functions (SDK & Proxy):**

  * **Chat Completions:** The core `litellm.completion()` (and async `acompletion()`) function provides a consistent way to call any text-generation model.[6, 3]
  * **Streaming:** Full support for streaming responses from all providers by simply setting `stream=True`.[1, 6]
  * **Multi-Modal & Advanced Functions:** Unified functions for a range of AI tasks [7]:
      * `image_generation()`
      * `embedding()`
      * `transcription()` (Speech-to-Text)
      * `speech()` (Text-to-Speech)
  * **Exception Handling:** Automatically maps provider-specific errors to standard OpenAI exceptions, simplifying error handling logic.[4]

-----

#### **3. The LiteLLM Proxy Server: Enterprise-Grade LLM Management**

The Proxy Server is designed for platform teams and production environments, offering a suite of powerful management features through a single API endpoint and a central `config.yaml` file.[4, 8]

  * **Unified API Key Management:** Create "virtual keys" that can be assigned to users, teams, or applications. These keys are managed within LiteLLM, abstracting away the underlying provider keys.[9]
  * **Cost Tracking & Budgets:** Automatically track spending for every request across all providers. Set budgets and spending limits on a per-key, per-team, or per-model basis to control costs effectively.[6, 9]
  * **Advanced Routing & Reliability:**
      * **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple deployments of the same model (e.g., across different Azure regions).[10]
      * **Fallbacks:** Configure automatic retries to a secondary model or provider if a primary request fails.[1]
  * **Observability:** Integrates with popular logging and monitoring platforms like Langfuse, Helicone, and MLflow to provide a single pane of glass for all LLM operations.[4]
  * **Admin UI:** A web interface for managing keys, models, teams, viewing spend logs, and configuring the proxy.[8]

#### **4. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Gateway**

LiteLLM extends its universal adapter philosophy to AI tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard for connecting AI applications with external tools and data sources.[11, 12] The LiteLLM Proxy acts as a central **MCP Gateway**, making any MCP-compliant tool accessible to any LLM it supports.[6, 13, 14]

**How it Works:**

1.  **Configuration:** You register MCP servers (which can be local `stdio` processes or remote `http/sse` services) in your `config.yaml` file.[14]
2.  **Discovery & Translation:** The proxy connects to these servers, retrieves the list of available tools, and translates their MCP schemas into the OpenAI function-calling format.[15]
3.  **Unified Access:** When you make a request to the proxy, it presents these translated tools to the target LLM (e.g., Claude, Llama, Gemini) in a format it understands. This makes the entire MCP ecosystem available to models that have no native MCP awareness.[6, 14]
4.  **Access Control:** You can control which keys or teams have access to specific MCP tools, ensuring secure and governed tool usage.[14]

#### **5. Priority-Based Rate Limiting (v1.77.3-stable and later)**

In high-traffic environments, a single proxy may serve multiple workloads with varying importance (e.g., production vs. testing). Without prioritization, low-priority, high-volume traffic could exhaust rate limits or create queues, delaying or causing failures for critical requests.[16]

To solve this, LiteLLM introduced **Request Prioritization**, a beta feature that allows for priority-based handling of incoming requests.[17]

**How it Works:**

  * **Priority Levels:** Requests can be assigned a priority level. The lower the numerical value, the higher the priority (e.g., `priority: 0` is higher than `priority: 100`).[17]
  * **Priority Queuing:** When under load, the LiteLLM proxy uses a priority queue to process requests. High-priority requests are processed before lower-priority ones, ensuring that critical services receive preferential treatment and are less likely to be rate-limited or delayed.[16, 17]
  * **Use Cases:** This is crucial for guaranteeing SLAs for customer-facing applications, preventing experimental workloads from impacting production traffic, and ensuring fair resource allocation across teams.[16]

**Configuration:**

Priority is assigned on a per-request basis by including a `priority` parameter in the API call body.

**Example cURL Request with Priority:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/chat/completions \
-H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-virtual-key" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "messages":,
  "priority": 10 
}'
```

**Example with OpenAI Python SDK:**

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:4000",
    api_key="sk-your-virtual-key"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=,
    extra_body={
        "priority": 10  # Lower number = higher priority
    }
)

print(response)
```
