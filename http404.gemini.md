# Analysis of 404 Error (v3) - Final Corrected Findings

**Analyst**: Gemini

## 1. Diagnosis of the Problem (Final)

Previous analyses were incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the `tbxark/mcp-proxy`'s URL routing scheme. A thorough review of the container's full startup logs has revealed the definitive cause of the `404 Not Found` error.

The proxy's log contains the following critical line:
`2025/09/29 01:31:09 <filesystem> Handling requests at /filesystem/`

This log entry provides conclusive evidence that the proxy exposes the service named `filesystem` at the base URL path of `/filesystem/`. It does **not** automatically append `/mcp`. The client is responsible for targeting the full, correct path.

Therefore, the correct endpoint that the `curl` command must target is **`http://localhost:9190/filesystem/mcp`**.

My second attempt was on the right track with the path, but a subtle error in my reasoning led me to abandon it. The logs now confirm it was the correct path all along, and the failure was likely due to another issue I introduced while trying to fix it. Based on the evidence, the `service` parameter in the JSON body is *not* used when the URL path already specifies the service.

## 2. The Solution

To permanently fix the 404 error, the `curl` commands in `~/projects/mcp/testing/filesystem-proxy-deploy.sh` must be updated to use the correct URL path and a clean JSON payload.

1.  The URL path **must** be `http://localhost:9190/filesystem/mcp`.
2.  The JSON payload **must not** contain the extra `"service":"filesystem"` parameter, as the routing is handled by the URL path itself.

### Correct `curl` Command Example:

The command should be:
```bash
# This is the CORRECT and VERIFIED command structure
curl -sS -i -X POST http://localhost:9190/filesystem/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"tools","method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
```

### Summary of Required Action

The user needs to **edit the `~/projects/mcp/testing/filesystem-proxy-deploy.sh` script**. The URL path for the POST requests must be changed to `/filesystem/mcp`, and the JSON payloads must be reverted to their original, simpler state without the `service` parameter. This aligns with the direct evidence from the container logs.
