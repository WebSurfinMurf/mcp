# Proxy Rename to proxy-sse Complete
*Date: 2025-09-07*
*Status: ✅ Successfully Renamed and Validated*

## Summary
Successfully renamed the proxy directory and all references to maintain consistency with the container naming (`mcp-proxy-sse`).

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Rename
- Renamed: `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/proxy/` → `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/proxy-sse/`

### 2. Updated Documentation
- `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/proxy-sse/CLAUDE.md` - Updated configuration path
- `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/STATUS.md` - Updated config file reference
- `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/STANDARDIZATION_COMPLETE.md` - Updated file path
- `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/NAMING_STANDARDIZATION.md` - Updated proxy path references

### 3. Created Environment File
- `$HOME/projects/secrets/mcp-proxy-sse.env` - Standardized environment configuration

### 4. Service Restart
- Stopped old proxy container
- Started with new path: `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/proxy-sse/servers-production.json`
- Connected to required networks (postgres-net)

## Verification
All services tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ filesystem - SSE endpoint responding
- ✅ postgres - SSE endpoint responding  
- ✅ timescaledb - SSE endpoint responding
- ✅ All other services operational

## Current Container Status
```
mcp-proxy-sse       Running on port 8585
mcp-filesystem      Spawned on demand
mcp-fetch          Spawned on demand
mcp-postgres-stdio  Spawned on demand
mcp-timescaledb    Spawned on demand
```

## Consistency Achieved
- Directory: `proxy-sse`
- Container: `mcp-proxy-sse`
- Config: `/home/administrator/projects/mcp/proxy-sse/servers-production.json`
- Secrets: `$HOME/projects/secrets/mcp-proxy-sse.env`

All naming now follows consistent pattern!
